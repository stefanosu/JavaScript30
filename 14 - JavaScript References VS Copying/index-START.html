    // start with strings, numbers and booleans

    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    const team = players
    console.log(players, team);
    
    // You might think we can just do something like this:

    // however what happens when we update that array?

    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
      const team1 = players.splice()
      console.log(team1);
    // one way

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in 
    const team2 = [].concat(players)
    console.log(team2);
    
    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const team3 = [... players] 
    team3[3] = 'steve'
    console.log(team3);
    
    const team4 = Array.from(players)
    console.log(team4);
    

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    console.log(person);
    
    // and think we make a copy:

    // how do we take a copy instead?
    const person1 = Object.assign({}, person, {age: 21, job: 'teacher'})
    console.log(person1);
    

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread

    const steve = {
      name: 'steve', 
      age: 32, 
      city: 'NYC',
      social: {
        twitter: '@stefanosugbit'
      }
    }
    console.log(steve);
    
    const dev = Object.assign({}, steve)
    console.log(dev);
    
    const dev1 = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(steve)) 

    const dev2 = Object.assign({}, dev1,  {college: 'CCNY', major: 'PoliSci'})
v
    console.log(dev2);
    

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
